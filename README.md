## An OptaPlanner project to create a lessons time table for the Italian High Schools
This project is based on Red Hat Quarkus and Optaplanner technologies and the purpose is to create an on line tool to model a timetable for
the Italian High Schools.  

## Why the name?
Giuseppe Peano was an Italian mathematician and glottologist. When I started the project I thought it should be dedicated to a matematician, 
if possible to an Italian matematician, furthermore Peano is also the name of the institute where I have been studing my High School. That's why.
